# WebStore1

This was my initial attempt at using Spring MVC to build the web storefront. Right now, there are some things about Spring MVC that
I do not understand. At this time, there is a minimal HMTL frontend that is capable of taking input and displaying it in the view,
but there is no business logic. 

I will be spending more time learning how Spring works.
